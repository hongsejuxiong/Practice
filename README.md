Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
 not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
 to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
 (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
 See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
